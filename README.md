# Computer Vision - Project 1

This assignment contains three main parts: spatial filtering, frequency analysis, and frequency filtering. It
is designed for you to explore and gain deeper understanding of the underlying concepts in these topics by
implementing code, experimenting on real images, and making observations and drawing conclusions about
your results. For each of the three parts, you will need to write a Python script and then use this code to
on the provided image data (see section below). Write down your experimentation and observations in a
Google Doc, Word, or LaTeX document and include images with your explanations.
